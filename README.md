## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

This sample is provided **strictly for research and educational purposes**.  
Do not execute the binaries. Use in sandboxes or analysis environments only.

The behavior and operational signature **strongly resembles tools disclosed in the 2017 Vault 7 leak**, associated with a certain U.S. intelligence agency known for global surveillance operations.

Whether this sample is a fork, evolution, or unreported sibling remains unclear ‚Äî but its stealth, impersonation, and delivery method are consistent with state-grade implants historically linked to **Langley-based interests**.
