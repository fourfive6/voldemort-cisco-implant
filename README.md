In-the-wild malware sample masquerading as Cisco Webex – April 2025
## 🧠 Overview

- Masquerades as: `CiscoCollabHost.exe`, `CiscoSparkLauncher.dll`
- Installation: `AppData\Local\CiscoSparkLauncher`
- Persistence: Scheduled Task (user-level)
- Behavior: Likely DLL sideloading, stealth backdoor tactics
- Suspected C2: Abuses cloud infrastructure (Google Sheets, Cloudflare IPs)
- File size: ~600MB — possibly sandbox evasion by design

## 🛠️ Observed Files

- `CiscoCollabHost.exx`
- `CiscoSparkLauncher.dl_`
- Multiple log/config files

All files are renamed to prevent accidental execution.

## 📦 Sample Files

All renamed binaries are available directly in this repo under `artifacts/`.  
Do NOT run these. They are for research and analysis only.

- `CiscoCollabHost.exx`
- `CiscoSparkLauncher.dl_`
- Log files

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This sample is provided **strictly for research and educational purposes**.  
Do not execute the binaries. Use in sandboxes or analysis environments only.

The behavior and operational signature **strongly resembles tools disclosed in the 2017 Vault 7 leak**, associated with a certain U.S. intelligence agency known for global surveillance operations.

Whether this sample is a fork, evolution, or unreported sibling remains unclear — but its stealth, impersonation, and delivery method are consistent with state-grade implants historically linked to **Langley-based interests**.
